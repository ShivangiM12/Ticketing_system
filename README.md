Basic Queries======================================================================================

You can use SQL to get data from a table. For example:

```sql
SELECT Name, Age FROM People;
```

This query retrieves names and ages from the "People" table.

 JOINS=============================================================================================
Joining tables allows you to combine data. Here's how you can join the "Users" and "Roles" tables:

```sql
SELECT U.Username, R.RoleName
FROM Users U
JOIN Roles R ON U.RoleID = R.RoleID;
```

This query lists users with their corresponding roles.

 Handle Missing Data=================================================================================

NULL values represent missing or unknown data. For instance, you can find tickets without an assignee:

```sql
SELECT Title
FROM Tickets
WHERE AssigneeID IS NULL;
```

Sample Queries=======================================================================================

Here are some practical queries:

- List all open issues.
- Count issues by priority.
- Find comments with missing commenters.
- Update the assignee of a specific ticket.
- Calculate the average comment count per ticket.

Feel free to explore these examples and adapt them to your needs.
Conclusion

SQL is a powerful tool for working with databases. These basic queries, joins, and handling NULL values are fundamental concepts that can help you retrieve and manipulate data effectively.

Remember that SQL can be more complex for advanced tasks, but this README should give you a good starting point for understanding the basics.
